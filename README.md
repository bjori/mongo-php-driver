non-functional. Please do not even think about using this in production.
Development progress is being tracked in the
[pecl-prototype](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PHP/component/13249) component
of the MongoDB PHP driver's JIRA project.

This repo contains design documentation, examples, and a proof-of-concept
implementation of a new MongoDB driver for PHP, Phongo. Unlike the
[existing driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-driver), this project
utilizes [libmongoc](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver) and
[libbson](https://github.com/mongodb/libbson).

The purpose of this driver is to provide exceptionally thin glue between MongoDB
and PHP, implementing only fundemental and performance-critical components
necessary to build a fully-functional MongoDB driver.

In the long run, we hope that userland packages will be built atop this driver
to implement various APIs (e.g. a BC layer for the existing driver, new fluent
interfaces), management utilities (for creating admin utilities and cluster
management applications), and other interesting libraries.

The goal is to encourage community contribution and involvement with these
components (with a lower barrier of entry) while also keeping the overall design
fast and powerful.

## API

### Examples

 * [Model classes](docs/examples/model.php) (referenced in other examples)
 * [Querying](docs/examples/query.php)
 * [Inserting](docs/examples/insert.php)
 * Custom [BSON deserialization](docs/examples/changing-types.php)

## Development

The API is developed using normal PHP userland syntax:

 * [Connection Manager](docs/api/MongoDB/Manager.php)
 * [ReadPreference](docs/api/MongoDB/ReadPreference.php)
 * [WriteBatch](docs/api/MongoDB/WriteBatch.php)
 * [WriteResult](docs/api/MongoDB/WriteResult.php)
 * [Query](docs/api/MongoDB/Query.php)
 * [QueryResult](docs/api/MongoDB/QueryResult.php)
 * [Command](docs/api/MongoDB/Command.php)
 * [CommandResult](docs/api/MongoDB/CommandResult.php)

The implementation of these objects use CIMPL (Simple) and CEF (Chef) inline
code snippets which are then included in the generated C code.

The goal is that this PHP implementation can serve as the canonical
implementation of the driver and then used to generate extensions for other PHP
implementations (e.g. HHVM).

## Installation

Ultimately, this extension is not intended to be explicitly installed. Users
should choose one (or more) userland PHP libraries that depend on this driver,
and install them using Composer. At some point in the future, Composer may
support installing extension dependencies.

This project is currently not published as a PECL extension and must be built
and installed manually.

To build the driver:

```
$ phpize
$ ./configure
$ make
```

To install the driver:

```
$ make install
```

## Testing

To execute the driver's test suite:

```
$ make test
```

Some tests depend on userland PHP libraries (e.g. creating data fixtures) and
may be skipped if those dependencies are not available. Those libraries may be
installed with via Composer:

```
$ make composer
```
